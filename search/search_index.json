On this site you'll find recipes for deploying Tethys Platform using a variety of techniques. The solution that will work best for you will depend largely on your experience and needs of your applications. Here's a short list of some of the deployment solutions that are covered in this site: Virtual Machine on Commercial Cloud Docker Deployment with Docker Compose Automated Deployment using Kubernetes FAQ What is Tethys Platform? Tethys Platform is an open source web development platform that lowers the barrier to developing scientific web applications. For more information visit www.tethysplatform.org. What is the Commercial Cloud? The term \"commercial cloud\" refers to the various cloud computing services provided by companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and many other companies. These companies provide a streamlined approach to renting servers, storage, and other computing resources. They also take care of maintaining the hardware and fixing problems when they arise. What is a Virtual Machine? A virtual machine is a computer or server (guest) that runs as an application on a physical computer (host). In the context of servers, virtual machines are used to optimize hardware resources by having multiple virtual servers running on a single physical machine. What is Docker? What is Kubernetes? Why so many options? While creating web applications is easier with Tethys Platform, deploying them in a production environment still remains challenging. Part of what makes it challenging is that there is no single solution that will work for everyone.

Login to Azure Portal Navigate to https://azure.microsoft.com/ and Sign In using the Sign in link. Open the user dropdown menu and click on the Azure Portal link. Azure Portal link in the user menu. 2. Navigate to Virtual machines management page Use the search bar to search for \"Virtual machine\" and select the Virtual machines link. Search for \"Virtual machine\". 3. Create virtual machine Click on the Create button to open the drop-down menu and select Virtual machine . Create a new virtual machine. 4. Configure virtual machine Fill in the \"Create a virtual machine\" form as follows: Project Details Subscription : Select the desired subscription that will be used for billing the virtual machine usage. Resource group : Select a resource group or create a new one using the Create new link. Instance Details These are technical details about the virtual machine that will be created. Virtual machine name : Give the virtual machine a name. Region : Select an appropriate region, this is the approximate location of the data center where the virtual machine will be created. Image : Search for \"tethys-platform\" and select the \"tethys_platform/tethys-platform-base/latest\" image. Size : Choose the size of hardware for your virtual machine. We recommend a machine with at least 2 cpus (vcpus) and 4 GiB of memory (e.g. Standard_B2s). Click on the See all sizes link to see a list of all the sizes to compare costs. Administrator account Specify the credentials for the administrator account as well. This account will be used to log in to the virtual machine: Authentication type : We recommend using SSH public keys, but you can use a password if you are not sure what an SSH key is. Username : Create a unique username (don't use something generic like \"admin\"). SSH public key source and Key pair name : if using SSH keys, you can choose to create a new key pair or use an existing key pair if you have one already. Inbound port rules Public inbound ports : Select Allow selected ports . Select inbound ports : Select SSH (22) and either of HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443) . Licensing License type : Select Other . Example of the \"Create a virtual machine\" form. 5. Create disks Press the Next: Disks > button to proceed to the Disks tab. You will create the hard drive for the virtual machine to use on this page. Disk Options OS disk type : Select the type of disk you'd like the VM to have. We'd recommend one of the SSD options. Standard SSD should work for a lot of deployments, but if you plan to use GeoServer, you may want to consider Premium SSD for better performance. Encryption type : adjust to taste. Data disks (optional) Use this section to attach additional disks to the VM if you'd like. 6. Review other tabs The default options in the other tabs should be ok, but take a few minutes to click through the tabs and review the options. When you are done, click on the Review + create button. 7. Review and create Review the options and make any changes if needed. Then press the Create button. Attention If you chose to generate a new key pair, don't forget to download the private key. Keep this file in a safe place and don't lose it. 8. Twiddle thumbs It will take a few minutes for the virtual machine and side-car resources to be created. You should be taken to a progress page like the one below that will keep you apprised of the deployment status. Deployment progress page. 9. Review resource page When finished, the progress page will report something like \"Your deployment is complete\". At this point, press the Go to resource button. This will bring you to the Overview page of the Virtual Machine. This view provides a sort of dashboard for the virtual machine and provides controls for starting, stopping, and connecting to the virtual machine. Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the Overview page. If you are feeling brave you may also want to click through the other links in the navigation on the left to familiarize you with their content. Virtual machine resource overview page. 10. View the Tethys Portal A few minutes after the Virtual Machine starts, Tethys Portal should be viewable. Locate the Public IP address field in the Essentials section (top-right). This is the IP address the virtual machine and where you can access it for now. a. Press the Copy to clipboard button next to the IP address. Copy the public IP address. b. Paste the IP address in the address bar of a new tab in your web browser. A default version of Tethys Portal should be displayed. Tethys Portal running on Azure VM. Note It can take Tethys Platform a few minutes to start up after the VM starts. If you receive a 502 Gateway error, wait a few minutes and try again.
