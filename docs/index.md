# Welcome

The goal of this site is to provide documentation for several production deployment options   [Tethys Platform](http://www.tethysplatform.org/).

On this site you'll find recipes for deploying Tethys Platform using a variety of techniques. The solution that will work best for you will depend largely on your experience and needs of your applications.

Here's a short list of some of the deployment solutions that are covered in this site:

* Virtual Machine on Commercial Cloud
* Docker Deployment with Docker Compose
* Automated Deployment using Kubernetes

## FAQ

### What is Tethys Platform?

Tethys Platform is an open source web development platform that lowers the barrier to developing scientific web applications. For more information visit www.tethysplatform.org.

### What is the Commercial Cloud?

The term "commercial cloud" refers to the various cloud computing services provided by companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and many other companies. These companies provide a streamlined approach to renting servers, storage, and other computing resources. They also take care of maintaining the hardware and fixing problems when they arise.

### What is a Virtual Machine?

A virtual machine is a computer or server (guest) that runs as an application on a physical computer (host). In the context of servers, virtual machines are used to optimize hardware resources by having multiple virtual servers running on a single physical machine.

### What is Docker?

### What is Kubernetes?

### Why so many options?

While creating web applications is easier with Tethys Platform, deploying them in a production environment still remains challenging. Part of what makes it challenging is that there is no single solution that will work for everyone.
